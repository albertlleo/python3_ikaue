# python3 ikaue NLP project

Here will be a sample of how a complete python3 project must be done.



## Prerequisites
It is recommended to create a [virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) to
avoid any dependency conflicts with other projects. The project needs to run Python 3.6 or higher. 

To create the virtual environment Using `venv` with Python 3.6 or higher you can create a virtual environment as follows:

```
$ python3 -m venv ENV_DIR

$ source  ENV_DIR/bin/activate
```

Activate your environment according to instructions above.

Upgrade to the most recent version of pip by calling:

```
$ pip install --upgrade pip

$ pip install wheel
```

Another alternative is using `virtualenv` as described
[here](https://the-hitchhikers-guide-to-packaging.readthedocs.io/en/latest/virtualenv.html#creating-a-virtualenv).

For this step, please checkout the repository and activate your virtual environment.
**For developers (i.e. if you will edit the source code), please install using:**

```
pip install -e .
```

All depending packages are installed in the virtual environment, but the actual source code of this
package is copied to the site-packages folder. You should edit and run the code from the
checked-out source directory.

For users **who do not intend to edit the source code**, run:

```
pip install .
```

For installing test dependencies, run: 
```
pip install .[testing]
```


## Running
```
$ cd /NLP_ikaue/bin
$ python3 NLP_extractor.py word_list.txt
```
## Running Tests
```
$ pytest
```
